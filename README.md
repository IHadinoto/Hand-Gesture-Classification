# Hand-Gesture-Classification
Classifying Hand Gestures taken from Leap Motion Device

Hand gestures are commonly used in entertainment and games whereby users perform different gestures which are noted by a computer. It is also commonly used in communications where it enhances the experience of conveying information through presentations. Perhaps most importantly, gestures using sign language are commonly used in the deaf community to communicate with the world, allowing them to contribute to society in many ways.

The identification of hand gestures can be grouped into two different problems, classification and object detection. Classification involves determining the type of hand gesture present in a set of still images. The hand gestures are normally located in the same coordinates within the images. Object detection adds localisation to classification, to determine the location of a gesture in an image or video. These gestures may also be obstructed or not immediately obvious to the neural network or viewer.

Attempts have been made to perform gesture recognition using computer vision. However, these have not proven to be robust. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to perform image classification on 10 different hand gestures through the training of a neural network on a pre-defined dataset.
